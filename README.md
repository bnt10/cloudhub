# SCMP (Snet Cloud Monitoring Portal)

## Intro.
**SCMP** is **another branch** of an open-source web application derived from Influxdata's **_Chronograf_** written in Go and React.js that provides the tools to visualize your monitoring data and easily create alerting and automation rules.

Therefore, SCMP will be enhanced by adding our direction, such as automation of configuration management and monitoring over Clouds.

SCMP has been started with _Chronograf_ version **1.7.11**.

For more information of the basic common features between _Chronograf_ 1.7.11 and SCMP, dependencies and using guides like the way of TICK Script or Flux queries, refer to the following link.
